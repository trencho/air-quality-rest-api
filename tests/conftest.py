"""Make the test suite hermetic: no network, no reliance on generated data.

Two things aren't committed (``data/`` is gitignored) yet the endpoint tests in
``test_api.py`` need them:

* **Raw location JSON** (``cities``/``countries``/``sensors``). In prod/CI these come
  from the scheduler's live ``fetch_locations`` call; importing the app used to trigger
  that network fetch on every ``create_app()``. We now set ``SKIP_DATA_FETCH`` (read in
  ``create_app``) so the import stays offline, and seed a trimmed skopje/MK/1000 slice
  from the committed fixtures under ``tests/fixtures/raw`` instead.
* **Processed CSVs** for skopje/1000, which the history/pollutants endpoints read. All
  four data-dependent tests resolve to skopje/1000 (the coordinate tests use that
  sensor's exact position), so seeding one sensor is enough.

Seeding is **create-only**: we write a file only if it's absent and remove only the
files we created, so a developer's real local ``data/`` is never clobbered. Raw seeds
we create are left in place on teardown (``data/`` is gitignored, so leftovers never
dirty the tree and serve as a valid seed for the next run).
