"""Tests for ``api.blueprints.fetch_dataframe``, the shared history-CSV reader.

Every history and pollutants endpoint reaches its data through this one helper, and it
has three outcomes a caller has to tell apart: a frame, a 404 because the sensor has no
data yet, and a 404 because the file could not be read at all.

It used to reach the second of those by ``raise Exception`` inside its own ``try`` purely
to jump into the handler that returns the 404 — so the ordinary case of a city having no
history logged a manufactured traceback, and a real read failure was indistinguishable
from it in the log. These pin the outcomes so the restructure is not free to change them,
and pin the one thing that genuinely did change: an unexpected error now propagates
instead of being answered with a 404.
