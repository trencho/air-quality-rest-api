"""Tests for the two scheduled jobs in ``src/api/config/schedule``.

``import_data`` carries a regression test for its walk + rmdir (bug A2): after importing
files it prunes empty leftover directories under ``DATA_EXTERNAL_PATH`` with
``root.rmdir()`` — but ``root`` is a ``str`` yielded by ``os.walk``, which has no
``rmdir``, so the job raised ``AttributeError`` the moment it met an empty directory. The
fix wraps it as ``Path(root).rmdir()``.

``fetch_locations`` carries the tests for the last-good-copy guard. ``fetch_countries``,
``fetch_cities`` and ``fetch_sensors`` each answer an upstream failure by logging and
returning ``[]``, and the job used to write that straight to disk — so one pulse.eco
outage emptied the location catalogue that ``read_cities`` and ``read_sensors`` serve, and
every downstream job then had nothing to iterate over until the next successful run.
